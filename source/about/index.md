# Disceptio

## What is Disceptio?

We build products that make people better at their most important work — the kind of work you read about on the front page of the newspaper, not just the technology section. For ten years, we’ve built our company by being unconventional and open-minded. We’ve been willing to try things that people said would never work, and we’ve adapted when we’ve been wrong. Where we’ve succeeded, it’s because we’ve been different.

## Our Philosophy

### THE BEST IDEA WINS

If you have a great idea and the will to see it through, you can effect great change. Nothing is off limits—we’re constantly looking for improvements in our products, our processes, and our people. All voices are equal here—we hire people to have an opinion and be creative. We’re intolerant of politicking, ego, and power brokers. If your idea makes the most sense, that’s what we’re doing, regardless of your role or seniority.

### NOTHING IS PERMANENT

Sometimes opportunities are here today and gone tomorrow. Sometimes a breakthrough on an intractable problem invalidates our previous efforts. And yes, sometimes we make mistakes. Inventing the future requires detaching yourself from the past. While we ship a couple of polished product families, we’re just getting started when it comes to building the full ecosystem of technology we’ve imagined.

### KEEP FOCUSED ON THE MISSION

Our work is incredibly complex, touching on computer science, data science, software engineering, public policy, good governance, large-scale distributed systems, user behavior, efficient use of resources... to name a few. It would be easy to get hyper-focused on some small aspect of this large universe and spend way too much time and resources on perfecting something that’s good enough already.
